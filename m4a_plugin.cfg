# M4A Plugin Configuration
#
# Copy this file to m4a_plugin.cfg (same directory as m4a_plugin.clap)
# and edit the values below.
#
# The plugin reads this file on startup. To apply changes after editing,
# remove and re-insert the plugin in your DAW, or save/reopen the project.

# Path to the project root directory.
# Works with pokeemerald, pokefirered, and forks.
# On Windows, use backslashes or forward slashes - both work.
# Example: C:\Users\you\pokeemerald
project_root=\\wsl$\Ubuntu-22.04\home\huderlem\pokeemerald

# Voicegroup name to load (without path or extension).
# The loader auto-discovers the project structure and searches for the
# voicegroup in individual files (sound/voicegroups/<name>.inc) and
# monolithic files (sound/voice_groups.inc with <name>:: labels).
# Examples: petalburg, littleroot_town, voicegroup000, prologue
voicegroup=petalburg

# Reverb amount (0 = none, 127 = maximum).
reverb=50

# Master volume (0-15). 15 matches the GBA's default.
master_volume=15

# Song Master volume (0-127)
song_master_volume=83

# Additional .inc files for sample symbol definitions (semicolon-separated, relative to project_root).
# Normally auto-discovered from sound/direct_sound_data.inc.
#sound_data_paths=

# Additional voicegroup search directories or files (semicolon-separated, relative to project_root).
# Normally auto-discovered under sound/. Use this for custom locations outside the standard structure.
#voicegroup_paths=sound/eventide_music/voice_groups

# Additional sample search directories (semicolon-separated, relative to project_root).
# When a sample symbol isn't found in direct_sound_data.inc, the loader searches these
# directories for <symbol>.wav files.
#sample_dirs=sound/eventide_music/samples/wav

# Optional: diagnostic log file path. Uncomment to enable GUI debug logging.
# Useful for diagnosing GUI problems (e.g. why the GUI window doesn't appear).
# On Windows: use a path you can write to, e.g. your Desktop or C:\Temp.
#log=D:\m4a_plugin.log
